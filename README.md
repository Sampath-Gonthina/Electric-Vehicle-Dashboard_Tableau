# *KPI Requirements*

1. **Total Vehicles**:  
   - *Purpose*: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, including both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth over time.

2. **Average Electric Range**:  
   - *Purpose*: Determine the average electric range of vehicles in the dataset to gauge technological advancements and efficiency in the EV market.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**:  
   - *Purpose*: Analyze the number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset and calculate their percentage relative to the total EVs, providing insights into the market share of fully electric vehicles.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**:  
   - *Purpose*: Identify the number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and calculate their share of the total EVs, offering insights into the hybrid vehicle segment and its popularity.
